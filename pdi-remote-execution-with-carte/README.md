### PDI Carte

Carte is a simple web server that allows you to execute transformations and jobs remotely.  It does so by accepting XML (using a small servlet) that contains the transformation to execute and the execution configuration.  It also allows you to remotely monitor, start and stop the transformations and jobs that run on the Carte server.
A server that is running Carte is called a Slave Server in the Pentaho Data Integration terminology.
